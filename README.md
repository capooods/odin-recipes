This will be my first HTML project under The Odin Project!

In this project, I have utilized the following:
* git add
* git commit -m "Message"
* git push origin main
* html boilerplate
* html headers
* html unordered list
* html ordered list
* html links and photos

I also practice making atomic commits to my project and using the proper subject for every commits.
